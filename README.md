# ArtaleTrainer
Hello user, this is a simple trainer that automates applying holy symbol on a HS mule. 
In addition, there's an autopot and autoskill function for general purpose training.
There is a 3 day free trial and then afterwards a price of $5 a month.

AutoPot Instruction:
Potential to set delay faster than pet's autopot delay for faster pot usage. I've included example png images of the HP and MP that needs to be used.Depending on the resolution of the computer you're using, if the given HP and MP images don't work, please screenshot and paste onto ms paint and crop
as similarly as the given images.

AutoBuff Instruction:
I've included 4 skill key inputs that can autobuff your character. Similarly to the autopot, you need to print screen 
the skill's image as it appears on the top right corner of the screen and crop it as tightly as possible and save it in the folder. 
Just enter the skill's shortcut key and the name of the png file that corresponds to the skill. (i.e. For "Haste.png", enter "Haste" for the skill's name without ".png").

Additional Notes:
-The game window must be placed on your primary monitor. Extended monitors will not work.
-If your priest does not walk properly out of FM, you can go into settings.json and change "FMWalk" duration
to the desired duration.
